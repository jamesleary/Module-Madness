Module Madness

In this challenge, you will need to spin up a new project (much like we did in lecture). You will create three modules as specified below, create a server.js that will use these modules!

Modules

[X] Module One (randomNumber.js)

The first module will export a function that returns a random number after taking in a min and max value as arguments (hint: you can use random number functions from previous assignments). When you call this module, use 100 as your min, and 1000000 as your max.

[X] Module Two (convertToDollars.js)

The second module should accept a number and convert it to a USD value. You can find some good implementations of this conversion online.

[X]Module Three (moduleThree.js)

The third module should require the other two modules (i.e. Module One and Module Two). It should have two function exports:

The first function export should return the result of the first module being passed into the second module.
The second function export should return the text “Account balance: \n”.

server.js

Finally, in the server.js file use the functions from your third module to produce the following output when you visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser:
